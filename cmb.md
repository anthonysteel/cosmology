# Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
  - The main resource for data seems to be the LAMBDA.
  - Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is filetype for image storage.
# Main Experiments
  - Planck
    - Satellite mission by the ESA (mainly France and Italy), NASA, and
      consortium funded by Denmark.
    - Objective to measure spatial anisotropies of the temperature of the CMB,
      with an accuracy set by fundamental astrophysical limits.
