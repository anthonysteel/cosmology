      - Proposing a relativistic gravitational theory leading to MOND.
      - 1983 [Bekenstein and Milgrom](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1984ApJ...286....7B&db_key=AST&page_ind=0&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_VIEW&classic=YES)
        proposed modification of ND for accelrations smaller than a_0 ~ 1.2 * 10^-10 m/s^2.

    - [Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian Gravity?](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1984ApJ...286....7B&db_key=AST&page_ind=0&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_VIEW&classic=YES)
      - Can be described by a modification of:
        - The law of inertia to  \mu(a/a_0)a = F
        - THe law of gravity \mu(g/a_0)g = g_N
      - Applying MOND equation to N-body system leads momentum not being
        conserved (Show this, [helpful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity)). B&M's contribution was presenting a model theory
        that is consistent with known conservation laws.
