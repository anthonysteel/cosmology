\chapter{Electric Cars}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{If an electric car uses electricity generated by coal does it
    produce less carbon emissions per unit of energy then an ICE?}
    Consider the mass of carbon emmitted per unit distance driven by an
    electric car and an ICE denoted $\eta_\text{e}$ and $\eta_\text{ICE}$
    respectively. The dimensions are:
    \[
      [\eta_\text{e}] = \frac{[M]}{[L]} = \underbrace{\frac{[M]}{[E]}}_{a} \underbrace{\frac{[E]}{[L]}}_{1/b}
    \]
    where $a$ is the mass of carbon produced per kWh by a coal plant, and $b$
    is the number of km's per kWh of charge. The U.S Energy Information Administration
    estimates $a = 0.42$ kg/kWh. For a Tesla Model 3:
    \[
      b = \frac{50}{400} \frac{\text{kWh}}{\text{km}} = \frac{5}{40}\frac{\text{kWh}}{\text{km}}
    \]
    giving:
    \[
      \eta_e = 2.1 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{km}}
    \]
    For the ICE:
    \[
      [\eta_\text{ICE}] = \frac{[M]}{[L]} = \underbrace{\frac{[M]}{[L^3]}}_{c} \underbrace{\frac{[L^3]}{[L]}}_{d}
    \]
    where $c$ is the number of kg's of carbon per litre and $d$ is the number of litres per km.
    The National Resources of Canada estimates $c = 2.3$ kg/L and $d = 9.0$ L/km. Therefore:
    \[
      \eta_\text{ICE} = 20.7 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{km}}
    \]
    So an electric car produces 10 times less carbon emission even if the fuel is
    generated by coal.
